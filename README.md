My Transition
=============

The starting point of this discussion is how to achieve a society where the below statements would be true (see Resource Based Economy [[RBE](http://www.thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/resource-based-economy)]):

1. resources must be equally distributed among all people
2. free access to those resources
3. no political system as we know it
4. the political system is replace by a technical one that keeps the balance
5. this system is maintained by everyone that would like to contribute, but it needs no human input to run
6. people strive to accumulate, share, develop knowledge (to be able to contribute)
7. there are no need for laws, except technical ones

If when reading some of the article here you get the feeling that this is impossible, try to ask yourself what should I add to make it possible.
It is all on you.
I know you will not let us down.

#Goals

We would like to use Git as a platform on top of witch we could build a new society.
We are going to build a new society with the use of Latex documents. Each of them is a transition proposals.
As it is clear now that our socio-economic system is not capable to care for us (the people), we are going to build a new one.
As far as this repository is concern the destination of this transition should be some kind of a system based on a Resource Based Economy.

## Long term

The best way to use our intelligence is to solve problems.
One of the biggest problem ever seems to be: What we need to do to become a civilized society on a planetary level?
With more fancy words: How to start the process that will lead us to a type 1 civilization [[Kardashev_scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)]?
But this problem was already solved. The solution is a RBA.
The true challenge is to synthesize the transition.
The long term goal is to use a distributed version control system the allow the community to express it's own creativity.
Each document (proposal) is a piece of legislation that could/should be sent to politician and one day be passed a law. 

## Medium term

Create and collaborate on proposals that tackle specific socio-economic problems.
Along the way verify if a version control system is the right platform.
We certainly need an uncentralized way of writing law.
There are a lot of similarities between writing laws and software.
The best practice in unsentralized software development is Git.
I believe Git could be the right way to allow millions of people to collaborate in the design of our society.

## Short term
Convince anybody to follow :)
