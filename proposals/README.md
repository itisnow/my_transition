Can an open source society work?

Why open source software works?
With proprietary software you show you are better then the people that wrote it by exposing all the faults of that software (you write viruses).
If it is open source you show how good you are by making the software better.

Should we write law in an open source way?
This way seams more efficient because there is less collateral damage.
